Learning record

3.23

Completed the first part of introduction to machine learning, and understood some basic applications of feature engineering and sklearn, including but not limited to data acquisition, feature extraction, feature preprocessing, principal component analysis, etc.

3.29

Complete the second part of machine learning, understand converter and predictor, basic classification algorithm, and use sklearn corresponding function practice, including but not limited to KNN algorithm, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest and model selection and tuning.

4.1

Complete the third part of machine learning, learning the basic regression algorithm -- linear regression, its improved algorithm, loss function reduction methods: normal equation, gradient descent (SD, SGD, SAG), methods to solve the overfitting phenomenon, such as L1, L2 regularization, ridge regression, etc.

4.2

Finish the introductory learning of machine learning, and understand the relevant algorithms of basic machine learning, such as classification problems in supervised learning (KNN, NBC, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression), regression problems (linear model, regularization), as well as k-means algorithm in unsupervised learning. Continue to work hard, and break through the wind and waves.
